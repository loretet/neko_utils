This package is intended to be used to work with Neko datasets.
In particular, it provides tools to:
- convert CSV files into xarray dataset with minimum information loss (works well for plotting and computing any order of statistically averaged quantities, but needs further testing for working with non-averaged quantities)
- open *0.f0* files by reading the XYZ coordinates from the *0.f00000 file (Neko currently stores coordinates only in the first *0.f0* file)


Usage:
- if one wants to convert a 'basic' 1D csv Neko statistics file to xarray using "y" as letter to indicate the height:
ds = csv_to_xr(/path/to/csv, basic=True, height="y")
- if one wants to open a Neko field file:
ds = nek_dataset(path = f"path/to/case/field0.f000{n}",
                 ref = f"path/to/ref/field0.f00000")


Install by cloning this repository and running << pip install -e . >> in the setup.py folder. 
Works also in conda environments.


Tested with Neko v0.9.1
